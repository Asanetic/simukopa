/**
 * Register real behavior here, once per action key. Both grid rowLinks
 * AND profile-level buttons (schema.profileActions) route through this
 * SAME registry — one place to add new behavior, works everywhere.
 *
 * Every registered function receives ONE ctx object instead of a fixed
 * list of positional args — see actionRegistryDocs.md (same folder) for
 * the full ctx field list and worked examples for every action shape
 * used elsewhere in this app (cross-module popups, preset create forms,
 * quick-edit modals, grid-toolbar smart filters, sending messages, etc).
 * Copy the block that matches what you're building from there.
 *
 * NOTE: "delete" and "clone" are intercepted directly by
 * useEntityFormController before they ever reach this registry — don't
 * register functions under those two keys, they will never fire.
